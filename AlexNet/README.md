# AlexNet
I tried to define the AlexNet model and train/evaluate it.  
It is based on a paper and the other references as below.

I used Tensorboard and estimate the accuracy of this model.

## Development Environment
__Prerequisite__: Python >= 3.6.3,  
                  Tensorflow >= r1.6.0  

## References
My paper review is as follows.
