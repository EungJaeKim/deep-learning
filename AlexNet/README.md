# AlexNet
I tried to define the AlexNet model and train/evaluate it.  
It is based on a paper and the other references as below.  

![Alt text](https://github.com/asyncbridge/deep-learning/blob/master/AlexNet/alexnet.png?raw=true)  
  
I used Tensorboard and estimate the accuracy of this model.

I trained the CIFAR-100 dataset. The number of training set and test set are 50,000/10,000.  
The input image size is 32x32x3 and it has 100 classes containing 600 images each.  
There are 500 training images and 100 test images per class.  

## Development Environment
__Prerequisite__: Python >= 3.6.3, Tensorflow >= r1.6.0  

## Review
My paper review is as follows.

It is based on a paper and the other references as below.  

Now updating...
